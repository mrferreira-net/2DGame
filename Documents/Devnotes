Notes:
- Remember to use pause on each setInterval

To do:
- Can probably just get rid of settings
button.
- Regulate firing speed, especially
when transitioning between targets.
- make wave sprite info nicer (more detail)
- create missile strike animation?
- create exhaust animations
- create more towers
- create more sprites
- vertical attack ("aerial sprites")
- pause, settings buttons
- Bug test like a mad man
